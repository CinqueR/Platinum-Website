            PlatinumGames Inc. is a Japanese Video game developer that was founded in October 2007 as result of a merger between two companies, 
            Seeds Inc. and Odd Inc. Shinji Mikami, Atsushi Inaba, 
            and Hideki Kamiya founded Seeds Inc. after the closure of Capcom's Clover Studio, while Odd Inc. 
            was founded by Tatsuya Minami. A year after the studio was founded, video game publisher Sega announced that it would be publishing four unique properties developed 
            by the company, which included MadWorld, Infinite Space, Bayonetta, and Vanquish. 
            Their partnership later extended to include Anarchy Reigns. 
            Most of these games were met with positive reception. Over the years, 
            PlatinumGames had developed an expertise in action games and one of their key philosophies 
            was that the team would not follow conventional game design concepts.
